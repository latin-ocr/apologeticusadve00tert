CHAPTER XLVI.

to the sanctions of morality which your lawe
necessarily lack.

We have answered all the charges against us,

and established the truth and beneficence of
our religion. Incredulity, however, still de-
nies the divinity of our saith, and charges it
with being merely a school of philosophy. If
it be so, why are we not treated with the
same leniency as the philosophersZ Philo-
sophers‚ though guilty, are acquitted on both
counts-—sacrilege and disloyalty3 why is not
the same privilege extended to us? As a
matter of fact we differ from the philosophers
both in knowledge and morals.

XLVII. Philosophers have borrowed ideas from the scrip-

tures, which are older than all systems of phi-
losophy, and have distorted them, as heretics
have corrupted the Truth delivered by Christ.

XLVIII. We are derided and tortured for teaching the

resurrection of the body3 yet the philosophie
argument for the transmigration of souls is
equally valid for our contention, which is
also justified by many analogies in nature.
We ourselves shall rise again, clothed upon
with the proper substance of eternity, but the
wicked will endure the punishment of eternal

fire.

XLIX. You applaud these opinions as philosophical

speculations, but as articles of Christian be-
lief you deride them. Yet they are of prac—
tical utility, and, even if mistaken, are inno-
cent and do not merit punishment. Besides,
this very power of inflicting punishment upon
us you enjoy solely at our own will and
pleasure.

L. We are willing to suffer because even in our

death we win a victory for the Truth. Wit-
nessed in others inflexible resolve and courage
gain your appIause, in us your hatred.

Proceed, then, in your unjust cruelty: our

steadfastness under persecution attracts new
convertS. Condemned by you, we stand
acquitted by God.
