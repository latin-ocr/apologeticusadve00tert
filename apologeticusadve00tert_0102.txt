64 Tertulliani Apologetz'cus [CAP. xvm.

duobus interpretibus indultis, quos Menedemus quoque phi-
losophus providentiae vindex de sententiae communione
suspexit. Affirmavit haec vobis etiam Aristaeas. Ita in
Graecum stylum ex aperto monumenta reliquit. Hodie apud.

5 Serapeum Ptolemaei bibliothecae cum ipsis Hebraicis litteris
exhibentur. Sed et J udaei palam lectitant 3 vectigalis libertas
vulgo aditur sabbatis omnibus. Qui audierit, inveniet Deum;
qui etiam studuerit intelligere, cogetur et credere.

Jerusalem to Alexandria in response to the request of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus, and that after conference and comparison the law was trans-
lated in seventy-two days. Oomp. Glem. Alex. Strom. i.. 22.

opinion with himself,' respecting a Providence. Joseph. Ant. Jud.

Hodie apud Serapeum. Theod. H. Ε. v. 32 3 Ammian. Marc.
xxii.. 16, ‘ In quo bibliothecae fuerunt inaestimabiles : et loquitur mo-
numentorum veterum concinens fides, septingenta voluminum millia,
Ptolemaeis regibus vigiliis intentis composita, bello Alexandrino . . .
conflagrasse.'

6. vectigalis libertas: ‘a taxed liberty.' Judaism was a religio
licita, liberty of worship being secured to them by their payment of
a tax imposed by Vespasian after the destruction of Jerusalem. This
tribute was the didrachma or half-shekel, originally devoted to the
service of the temple, but was transferred to the worship of Jupiter
on the Capitol3 Dion Cass. lxvi. 7 ; Joseph. Bell. dud. vi. 6 ; cp. Sueton.
Dom. 12. Tertullian inveighs against a purchased immunity from
persecution in defuga in pers. 12.

7. vulgo aditur sabbatis omnibus. The Jewish scriptures were
read in the synagogues on the sabbath according to a fixed lecffionary,
which provided passages From the Law and the Prophets3 cp. S. Luke
iv. 16 ff. ; and Wordsworth's notes,. Acts xiii. 15 3 xv. 21.
