xviii Introduction.

of Africa, and was written at Carthage ¹. The purpose of
Tertullian in presenting it was to show how baseless and
unreasonable were the charges which led to the persecutions
from which his *fellow-Christians were suffering. He made
an appeal to Roman common-sense, and delivered it with
that fiery vigour of impassioned pleading which was his
peculiar characteristic. The course of the argument will be
found in the Synopsis. His style is trenchant and forcible :
his sharp intellect and. impulsive temperament (acris et-
vehementis inqenii) hurry him along from point to point as he
triumphantly lashes with sarcasm and crushes his oppo-
nents. Tertullian was a skilled rhetorician‚ and though his
intense love of epigram and antithesis often involves his
style in harshness and obscurity, yet his originality and
brilliance always compensate for some u‘ncouthness of verbal

expression (cp. Lact. v. 1).

IV. Tertullian is conspicuous amongst the early defenders ·

of the Faith as the founder of the African school of
Christian apologetics. He was followed by Minucius Felix,

1 The APOLOGY itself furnishes evidence in opposition to the state-

ment of Eusebius (v. 5) that it was addressed to the Roman Senate.
It contains many expressions only natural from the pen of one writing

in a proconsular province and addressing a provincial executive.

1. The titles given to those to whom the work is presented—Romani
imperii antistites, ch. 1 ; praesides, ch. 2, 9, 30, 50,—-are not those
with which it would be natural to approach the Senate. The praesides
were provincial governors (‘ quorum [praetorum] in provinciis juris-
dictionem praesides earum habent‚’ Grai. Inst. i. 63 comp. Capitol.
Ant. Pius 6, ‘in provinciis bonos praesides detineret ’).

2. The expressions—imperium enjus ministri estis, eh. 2 ; ecce in
illa rel. urbe Aeneadum, 611. 9; Romae postremo . . . sanquinem Christ.
seminaverunt, ch. 21 ; ipsos Quirites, ipsam vernaculam septeni collium
plebem convenio, 611. 3 5—-plainly show that Tertullian was not writing
111 Rome; and the closing phrase of ch. 45, Deum non proconsulem

timentes, implies that the persons addressed. were living under a pro—
consular government. Compare too the manner in which Rome and

the Romans are spoken of ch. 21 and 24 pass.
