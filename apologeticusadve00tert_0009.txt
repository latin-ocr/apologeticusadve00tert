the basis of the present edition, but all the important
variant readings have, Ι hope, been noticed‚ While some

of the manuscripts of Tertullian’s writings is given in
the Introduction to the first volume of Oehler's edition,
and some remarks upon the same subject will be found
in the Preface to the volume of Tertullian in the Library
of the Fathers (Oxford‚ 1854).

I have thought it better not to overburden the notes

and the earlier authors quoted and referred to by these
