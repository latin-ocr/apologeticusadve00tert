CAP. V.] adversus Gentes pro Christianis, 21

nos e contrario edimus protectorem, si litterae M. Aurelii
gravissimi imperatoris requirantur, quibus illam Germanicam
sitim Christianorum forte militum precationibus impetrato
imbri discussam contestatur. Qui sicut non palam ab ejus—
modi hominibus poenam dimovit, ita alio modo palam dis· 5
persit, adjecta etiam accusatoribus damnatione, et quidem
taetriore. Quales ergo leges istae, quas adversus nos soli
exsequuntur impii, injusti, turpes, truces, vani, dementes?

word must be equivalent to aqyressorenz, persecutorem. So again the
verb, ch. 29, ‘ eos debellatis qui eam sciunt petere.’

1. protectorem. This seems a strange title by which to designate
Marcus Aurelius, but for the purposes of the present argument it was
convenient for Tertullian to ignore the fearful persecutions which
befel the Christians in this emperor’s reign: see the Introduction,
p. xv. Still, Aurelius was not personally a persecutor in the sense
in which e. 9. Decius was3 yet the question remains, How came such
a man to sanction persecution at all? See Merivale Hist. Rom. viii.
361 ff, that as emperor he felt bound to maintain the ancient laws of
the state religion; and de Pressense Early Years of Christiani& ii.
115 ff, that as a stoic philosopher it was impossible for Aurelius to
appreciate the Christian character.

si litterae M. Aurelii. Comp. ad Scap. 5. Euseb. v. 5 cites
Tertullian and Claudius Apollinaris, bishop of Hierapolis, both con-
temporary writers, in his account of the matter3 and the story re—
ceived embellishments from later authors3 Orosius vii. 173 Niceph.
iv. 12. The opportune shower is an historica] fact, Dion Cass. lxxi. 83
Capitol. M. Ant. Phil. 243 but the existence of such a letter as Tert.
mentions is universally discredited, as being controverted by the re—
presentation on the Antonine column, which attributes the shower to
the beneficence of Jupiter Pluvius3 and as being opposed to the general
policy of Aurelius towards the Christians. Mosheim suggests that
Tert. was thinking of the rescript of Antoninus Pius to the Assembly
of Asia, Euseb. iv. 133 but, as there given, the decree is spurious.
See a full discussion of the subject in Lightfoot Iynatins i. pp. 469—476‚
and the article Legio Fulminatrix, with an engraving of the Ant.
column, in Martigny's Diet. des Ant. caret.

2. gravissimi. See the character of Aurelius drawn by the his-
torian Capitolinus M. Ant. Phil. 2, ‘ Fuit a prima infantia gravis‚' ete.

4. Qui sicut non palam . . . dimovit. In the form of the letter given
by Eusebius (l. e.) the poena is removed, ἐκεῖνος ὃ καταφερόμενος ἀπολε-
λύσθαι τοῦ ἐγκλήματος, καὶ ἐὰν φαίνηται τοιοῦτος ὤν, ὁ δὲ καταφέρων ἔνοχος
ἔσται δίκης, but this may only have applied to Asiatics. Oomp. Euseb.
v. 21, where at Rome the accuser's legs were broken, and Apollonius

himself martyred (e. A.D. 186).
