CAP. 11.] adversus Gentes pro Christianis. 9

obstinationem non sacrificandi, nihil aliud se de sacramentis
eorum comperisse, quam coetus antelucanos ad canendum
Christo ut Deo et ad confoederandam disciplinam, homici-
dium, adulterium, fraudem, perfidiam, et cetera scelera
prohibentes. Tunc Trajanus rescripsit, hoc genus inquiren· 5
dos quidem non esse, oblatos vero puniri oportere. O
sententiam necessitate confusam! Negat inquirendos ut
innocentes, et mandat puniendos ut nocentes. Parcit et
saevit, dissimulat et animadvertit. Quid temetipsum cen-

Ι. allegans praeter obstinationem . . . nihil aliud. On this im-
portant testimony of an impartial heathen to the pure lives of the early
Christians see Merivale Hist. Rom. viii. 147, ‘ So ancient and genuine
a testimony to the virtue of the first believers . . . is justly regarded as
one of the proudest monuments of our faith. The letter of Pliny, it has
been well said, is the first Apoloqyfor Christicmity) Comp. note ch. 9.

de sacramentis : ‘ religious ordinances ' ; see note on sacramen-
tam, ch. 7.

2. coetus antelucanos. The Holy Eucharist was celebrated at
these early morning assemblies, as we learn from an interesting
passage de coron. 3, ‘ Eucharistiae sacramentum, et in tempore victus
et omnibus mandatum a Domino, etiam antelucanis coetibus, nec de
aliorum manu quam Praesidentium sumimus,’ etc.

hymnody see Bingham xiv. Ι, and Dior. Chr. Ant. s. v. HYMNS.

3. Christo ut Deo. This is the true reading, not ‘ et Deo, ’as some
mss. and edd. Pliny’s expression quasi deo, in the passage of which
this is a paraphrase, clearly determines the sense in which he under-
stood the Christian worship. A passage in an ancient writer, probably
Hippolytus or Caius (apud Euseb. v. 28), is equally clear in showing
that the early Christian hymns celebrated the- Deity of Christ : ψαλμοὶ
δὲ ὅσοι καὶ ᾠδαὶ ἀδελφῶν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς ὑπὸ πιστῶν γραφεῖσαι τὸν Λόγον τοῦ
Θεοῦ τὸν Χριστὸν ὑμνοῦσι θεολογοῦντες. Comp. Origen contr. Cels. viii.
673 Socr. H. E. vi. 8.

5. rescripsit. On the technical use of this word see note ch. 4.
Tertullian's criticism here of Trajan’s ruling is strictly a piece of
forensic pleading: he leaves out of sight the fact that the profession
of Christianity was a criminal offence previous to the emperor's rescript.
In reality Trajan's action was a moderate and statesmanlike policy of
repression without persecution of what he probably considered was a
dangerous political association. In ch. 5 Tertullian himself claims it
as a sort of check upon the officious enforcement of the earlier laws.

6. oblatos : ⁶ if brought up before the magistrates ' : offerri has this
sense below, and oblatio is the corresponding substantive.
