xxiv synopsis.

CHAPTER XIII. You dishonour them alike by your multiplicatiori of
their number, by your shameless traffic in them,
and by the character of those whom you admit to
their company.

XIV. You cheat them in your religious rites, and you ridi-
cule them m your literature.

XV. You deride them in your theatres, and pollute their
temples by the committal of the grossest sins. It is,
in fact, you yourselves who are guilty of sacrilege,
and not we Christians, who never enter your temples.

‚ XVI. After refuting certain erroneous ideas I will set forth
the main features of our religion.

We do not worship an ass’s head. You worship all
kinds of beasts and cattle.

If you assert that we pay homage to the cross, you
must plead guilty to the same charge.

If we were worshippers of the sun we should only re—

semble the Persians3 and our observance of Sun- -day
is met by your observance of Saturn' s day.

Your latest calumny about us is the monstrous ‘ ass-
born deity of the Christians 3' a monstrosity which
you surely might well worship: we only smile at
the absurdity.

,‚ XVII. We worship One God, the Creator of the universe,

invisible and incomprehensible, to whom nature and
the human conscience witness.

2, XVIII. Who, for our fuller and closer approach to Himself, gave
us His written word, and sent us inspired teachers.
XIX. Τ116 authority of the scriptures is vindicated by their
antiquity, which is higher than that of any heathen
record.
XX. Their majesty and divinity are obvious: history has
fulfilled, and is daily fulfilling, what they foretell.
XXI. The Jews regarded Christ as a mere man3 we acknow-
ledge Him as the Incarnate Son of God, who lived a
wonderful life, and was crucified, as He Himself-
and the prophets foretold. After His death He
rose again on the third day and finally ascended
into heaven. If His Divinity be true, all other re-

ligions must be false.
„ XXII. There are evil spirits called daemons, who work evil

amongst men, and deter them from coming to the
knowledge of the True God.
