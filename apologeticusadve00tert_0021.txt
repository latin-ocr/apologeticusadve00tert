Introduction. xv

several martyrdoms, notably S. Polycarp's (A.D. 15 5—6), have
to be dated in this reign.

On the death of Antoninus, Marcus Aurelius reversed the
methods of Trajan and Hadrian, and by far the severest
persecution which had yet befallen the Christians ensued.
Melito of Sardis (apud Euseb. iv. 26) addressing the emperor
and referring to events in Asia, states that in consequence of
a new and atrocious edict informants against the Christians
were encouraged by being presented with the property of the
accused, but he professes to doubt whether Aurelius was
personally responsible for the decree. However this may
have been, the roll of martyrs was replenished from all parts
of the empire‚ but the persecution seems to have fallen most
cruelly upon the Christians in the district of Lyon and Vienne
in A.D. 177 after the return of Aurelius to Rome for the
celebration of the thirty-fifth anniversary of his admission to
the proconsular power (Euseb. v. Ι). In A. D. 178 Aurelius
and his son Commodus set out on a renewed expedition
against the Marcomanni, but the death of Aurelius early in
the spring of 180 (March 17) left Commodus sole emperor,
and on his return to Rome the Christians enjoyed a temporary
respite (Euseb. v. 21). ⁴

From this date until the edict of Severus in 202 (see
below), no special enactments were put forth against the
Christians‚ and there are reasons for believing that the
APOLOGY was written before its promulgation. Yet, although
they lacked imperial insffigation, persecutions were both
frequent and severe (Clem. Alex. Strom. ii. 20. 125). They
were due to popular outbreaks (nec ulli magis depostulatores
Christianorum quam ‘umqum Apol. 35), private malice‚ and
especially to that mob-violence,—to which the magistrates
themselves were sometimes obliged to yield (Apol. 49)‚—which
wreaks its unreasoning vengeance upon a hated though
