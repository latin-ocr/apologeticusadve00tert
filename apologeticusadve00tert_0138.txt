CAPUT XXVIII.

QUONIAM autem facile iniquum videretur, liberos homines

5 invitos urgeri ad sacrificandum (nam et alias divinae rei
faciundae libens animus indicitur): certe ineptum existi-
maretur, si quis ab alio cogeretur ad honorem deorum,
quos ultro sui caussa placare deberet, ne prae manu esset
jure libertatis dicere: Nolo mihi J ovem propitium: tu, quis
10 es‘l me conveniat J anus iratus ex qua velit fronte ; quid tibi
mecum est-'l Formati estis ab iisdem utique spiritibus, ut
nos pro salute imperatoris sacrificare cogatis, et imposita et
tam vobis necessitas cogendi, quam nobis obligatio pericli-
tandi. Ventum est igitur ad secundum titulum laesae

1. fidei obstinatione. This construction is employed by Tacitus
with a similar signification, Hist. iii. 39, ‘ Blaeso . . . fidei obstinatio
fuit?

6. libens animus indicitur. See note, ch. 9.

10. me conveniat, ete. ‘Let J anus meet me threateningly with
whichever front he will.’ Comp. Pers. Sat. i. 58 ff„ ‘ O J ane, a
tergo quem nulla ‘ciconia pinsit,' eto.

13. obligatio. A word almost confined to juridical (and patristic)
latin. It is found in the Digests in the sense of ‘ an obligatory relation
involving two parties ’ ; here it used simply for ‘ duty?

14. Ventum est igitur. The first great charge, that of Sacrilege,
has now been disposed of; and Tertullian turns to the second indict-
ment alluded to, 011. Ιο, that of Disloyalty to the emperor and the state
(ch. 28-38). Emperor—worship, such as had been claimed by Caligula,
Nero, and Domitian (Sueton. calm. 22·; Tacit. Aom. xv. 743 Sueton.
Dom. 13), when developed and emended, soon became of more im-
portance than the worship of the national gods (see ch. 34, and notes).
The emperor was regarded as the incarnation and idealization of all
sovereign power, and, as such, was considered to be himself essentially
divine. Disloyalty was therefore a more serious indictment than
Sacrilege, not only in the view of the highest officials, but also in that
of the populace. Oomp. ad Nat. i. 17. It was a sin against the
commonwealth, and the Ohristians were branded with the reproach of
being bad subjects, hostes publici (ch. 35).

titulum. See note, ch. 44.
