50 Tertulliani Α polegelz'cus [CAP. XIII.

digne imperatoribus defunctis honorem divinitatis dicatis,
quibus et viventibus eum addicitis. Accepto ferent dii
vestri, imo gratulabuntur, quod pares eis fiant domini sui.
Sed quum Larentinam, publicum scortum, velim saltem
5Laidem aut Phrynen, inter Junones et Cereres ac Dianas
adoratis3 quum Simonem Magum statua et inscriptione
sancti dei inauguratis3 quum de paedagogiis aulicis nescio
quem synodi deum facitis: licet non nobiliores dii veteres,
tamen contumeliam a vobis deputabunt, hoc et aliis licuisse,
10 quod solis antiquitas contulit.

leq. ii. 8. 21, ⁶ sacerdotes diis apparento.' Op. the English use of
‘ apparitor.' ι

4. Larentinam. Laurentia or Larentina, the wife of Faustul'a,
according to the myth, and nurse of Romulus3 Liv. i. 4 ; Macrob. i. 10 3
Aul. GeII. vi. 7 ; Lact. i. 20. She is mentioned again contemptuously‚
ch. 2 5 (bis).

6. Simonem Magum. Op. Just. Mart. Apol. i. 34, 73 ; Iren. i. 203
Euseb. H. E. ii. 15 ; Gyr. J er. Cateeh. 6. The inscription is given by
J ustin: SIMONI DEO SANCTO. This statue, he says, ‘ stood by the Tiber
between the two bridges? At this very spot in 1574 the marble base of
a statue was found, inscribed SEMONI SANco 1)Εο FIDIO SAORUM SEX.
POMPEIUS, etc. ; and the general opinion of critics has been that J ustin
confounded Semo, the Sabine Hercules (Ovid Fasti vi. 21), with Simon
Magus (Vales. in Euseb. Z. e.). Tillemont (II. i. 341), however, points
out that 13110 inscriptions are not identical, the words and order differ-
ing; that J ustin states that the statue was set up by Claudius and the
Senate, whereas that to Semo was erected by a private individual; and
that Augustine, who knew of the Sabine Semo (de civ. Dei xviii. 19),
confirms Justin’s words (Haer. i. 6). Burton, also (Bamp. Lect. note
423 Charch Hist. p. 175, 3rd ed.), argues the impossibility of J ustin
being mistaken. On the other hand, Prof. Salmon, in Dict. Olor. Bioy.
iv. 682, thinks ‘the coincidence is too remarkable 130 admit of any
other satisfactory explanation ² 3 and believes that J ustin was deceived
by the Simonians in Rome.

7. paedagogiis aulicis nescio quem : ‘ some infamous court—page.'
Tertullian is alluding to Antinous and the temple dedicated to him
by Hadrian ; cp. Euseb. H. Ε. iV. 8 ; Origen contr. Cels. iii. 363 Just.
Mart. Apol. i. 293 Spartian. Hadr. 14.

8. synodi deum: ‘a god of the sacred synod' 3 i.e. not merely
deified, but admitted into the higher rank of those gods termed σύν-
θρονοι. An ancient inscription runs thus: ΑΝΤΙΝΟΩ ΣΥΝΘΡΟΝΩ
ΤΩΝ ΕΝ ΑΙΓΤΠΤΩ ΘΕΩΝ, etc.; cp. Prudent. contr. Symm. i. 271.
