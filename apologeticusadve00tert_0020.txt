xiv Introduction.

lation. From very early days Christianity, whether confused
with J udaism or distinguished from it, had been regarded with
ever-increasing disfavour by the pagan populace3 but Nero,
whatever may have been his motive, was the first emperor
who authorized a direct persecution of the Christians, Α.Ι). 64
(Tacit. Amr„ xv. 44 3 Sueton. Nero 163 Euseb. H. Ε. ii. 25;
Tert. Apol. 5). And the edicts against the Christians were
the only enactments of N ero's reign that remained unrepealed
at the time when Tertullian was writing (ad N at. i. ¹7). The
policy of ‘Vespasian and Titus (A.D. 69-81) scarcely affected
the progress of Christianity3 but the close of Domitian’s
reign (Ad). 95) was marked by a fitful attack upon it in
which the illustrious Flavius Clemens and his wife Domitilla
suffered (Euseb. H. E. iii. 17, 18). On the accession of
Nerva, Domitian’s edicts were rescinded and the exiles recalled
(Euseb. ib. 20).

The policy of Trajan (which Tertullian ridicul-es Apol. 2,
but views more favourably ib. 5) in his celebrated Letter to
Pliny, A.D. 112 (Epp. x. 97) must be judged leniently.
His decision formally and definitely confirmed the exist-ing
position at law of the Christians, pronouncing the profession
of their religion a crime, but securing for them a legal
trial and forbidding both officious enquiries and anonymous
accusations. It was by no means a direct attack upon
Christianity, yet it gave a fresh impulse to the hostility of
local officials who had already employed the same emperor's
earlier rescript against gilds and associations (to which Pliny
alludes ΕΜ). x. 96) to put a stop to the Christian assemblies
(see note Apol. 38). The attitude of Trajan was preserved by
Hadrian in his letter to Fundanus, ΑΛ). 124; while his
successor Antoninus Pius (ΑΛ). 138-161) is said to have been
even more lenient and to have issued edicts protecting the
Christians from fresh attacks (see notes Apol. 5), though
