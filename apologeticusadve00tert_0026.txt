can hardly be better summarized and contrasted than by
setting side by side the forcible canon of the ‘ Fourth
Gouncil of Carthage‚' (can. 16), ‘A bishop should not read
the books of the Gentiles‚' and the noble comment of the
ecclesiastica] historian Socrates on 1 Thess. v. 21, ‘ What
is good, wherever it may be, is the property of the Truth‚'
(H. E. iii. 16). For the Church at large could not afford to
lay aside so useful a weapon of defence as was ready to her
hand in the intimate knowledge of classic writings such as
many of her strongest champions possessed3 while her most
successful apologists—even those who most decried it--werc

and condemned3 for Tertullian invariably retorts upon the
accusers the charges alleged, whether of moral and crimina]

incidental and contingent upon the former. The main

reliyio Christiana iynorata damnetur (ch. 1) 3 and it was no
part of Tertullian's plan to produce a complete system of
Christian evidences, or to set out in detail the whole
doctrine and worship of the Catholic Church (comp. Lact.
