CAP. V.] adversus Gentes pro Christianis. 19

CAPUT V.

U'r de origine aliquid retractemus ejusmodi legum vetus
erat decretum, ne qui deus ab imperatore consecraretur, nisi
a senatu probatus. Scit M. Aemilius de deo suo Alburno.
Facit et hoc ad caussam nostram, quod apud vos de humano 5
arbitratu divinitas pensitatur. Nisi homini Deus placuerit,
Deus non erit3 homo jam Deo propitius esse debebit.
Tiberius ergo, cujus tempore nomen Christianum in saeculum
introivit, annuntiatum sibi ex Syria Palaestina, quod illic
veritatem illius divinitatis revelaverat, detulit ad senatum 10
cum praerogativa suffragii sui. Senatus, quia non ipse
probaverat, respuit, ,Caesar in sententia mansit, comminatus ,

2. Ut de origine . . . Christianorum. This passage is quoted by
Eusebius (H. Ε. ii. 2) from the Greek translation of the Apology.
Tertullian himself composed three treatises in Greek, which have been
lost, ‘ De Spectaculis,' ‘ De Virginibus Velandis,’ and ‘ De Baptismo ’:
see de coron. 6, de viry. vel. 1, de bapt. 15.

vetus erat decretum. Cicero de zeyibus ii. 8, quoted in the In-
troduction, p. xiii. For instances of the application of this law see Livy
iv, 303 xxv. 13 xxxviii. 183 and the reff. given below, ch. 6, under
‘ Liberum patrem ’ and ⁶ Serapidem.²

3. nisi a senatu probatus. So below, ch. 13, ⁴ status dei cujusque
in senatus aestimatione pendebat.'

4. Scit M. Aemilius. M. Aemilius was consul A.U.0. 638. The
god Alburnus is mentioned again adv. Mare. i. 18. Comp. Verg.
Geory. iii. 147 for the Lucanian mount, whence the name of the
deity.

8. Tiberius ergo. This statement is repeated by Eusebius H. E.
ii. 2, but Tertullian is the sole authority for ‘so remarkable a fact!
J ustin Mart. says nothing of such a proposal, though he twice men-
tions the Acts of Pilate (Apol. i. 45, 653 see below, ch. 21). The
story is now generally discredited3 but ‘it shows, and such is the
purpose for which Tertullian cites it, that the early indulgence of
the government to Christianity was an admitted fact which challenged
explanation,’ Merivale Hist. Rom. vi. 439.

12. comminatus. Kaye remarks (p. 105), ‘This threat appears to
me to have referred to the inveterate hostility manifested by the Jews
against Christ and His disciples, which had come to the emperor's
knowledge through the account transmitted by Pilate.’
