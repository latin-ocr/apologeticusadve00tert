22 Tertulliani A pologetz'cus [CAP. v.

quas Trajanus ex parte frustratus est vetando inquiri Chris-
tianos, quas nullus Hadrianus, quanquam curiositatum om-
nium explorator, nullus Vespasianus, quanquam J udaeorum
debellator, nullus Pius, nullus Verus impressit. Facilius

5 utique pessimi ab optimis quibusque, ut ab aemulis, quam a ·

suis sociis eradicandi judicarentur.

1. quas Trajanus ex parte frustratus. However illogical the
decision of Trajan might be in strict law (above, ch. 2) its ruling was
on the whole generous towards the Christians. Ghristianity had
always been illegal: Trajan reaffirmed the fact, but foi-bade its pro-
fessors to be sought out or to be anonymously accused. They were
regarded as criminals, but placed in a better position than ordinary
criminals.

2. Hadrianus, Hadrian, the dilettante philosopher and art-patron,
issued a rescript (preserved by J ustin Martyr Apol. i. 90, and quoted
by Euseb. iv. 8, 9) in A.D. 124, of similar purport to the letter of Trajan
to Pliny. It was addressed to Minucius Fundanus the proconsul of
Asia, and was intended to secure for the Christiane a formal trial and
to protect them from slanderous informers.

quanquam curiositatum, ete. On the inquisitive and versatile
character of Hadrian see Spartian. Hadr. 1, 2, 13 ff; Aurel. Victor
Epit. 143 Eutrop. viii. 7; Euseb. H. E. v. 5. See Merivale Hist.
Rom. viii. 182 ff.

3. Vespasianus. Early Christian authors are unanimous in as·
serting. that no persecution was directed against the Christians by
Vespasian (ΑΒ. 69-79) or by his son Titus (79-81). Comp. Euseb.
iii. 17, Δεύτερος [i.e. Domitian] δῆτα τὸν καθ’ ἡμῶν ἀνεκίνει διωγμόν,
καίπερ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Οὐεσπασιανοῦ μηδὲν καθ’ ἡμῶν ἄτοπον ἐπινοή-
σαντος. .

4. Pius. Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161) is generally admitted to
have shown a leniency to the Christians which was an advance upon
the action of Hadrian3 but his edicts to the people of Larissa, Thessa-
lonica, Athens, and to the Greeks generally, in favour of the Christians
mentioned by Melito of Sardis (apud Euseb. iv. 26), are not‘extant.
See the Introduction, p. xiv. For his conduct as a prince see Marcus
Aurelius Medit. i. 6 3 Capitol. Ant. Pius 2, 7.

Verus. Either Lucius Verus, who may have taken no part in
the persecuting policy of his colleague‚ or Marcus Aurelius Verus
himself, whose attitude towards the Christians Tertullian so strangely
misrepresents; see note above, protectorem. ‘ Severus ' is the reading
of the Paris MS. “

impressit. Absol. ‘sanctioned,' ‘put into operation.' The me-

taphor is probably taken from sealing, and therefore countenancing
with one's authority.
