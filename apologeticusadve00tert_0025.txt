Cyprian, Arnobius‚ ancl Lactantius. This school was distin-
guished by the cogency of its appeals alike to justice and the
human conscience, the force of its forensic pleading on behalf
of Christianity, and the keenness of its attack upon paga-
<nism 3 yet its penetration was somewhat marred by a narrow—
ness of view which regarded all history, all thought, and
all religion, previous to the Advent of Christ as abhorrent:
paganism in every form stood absolutely condemned as
the rival effort of the opponent 01 God to enslave the

Divine truth and light; the other found in it an evidence of
the natural craving of the human for the Divine. So Tertul-
lian denied that the Church and the Academy had anything
in common (de praescr. haer. 73 Apol. 46); while Origen and

S. Clement held that the ‘true scribe brings all kinds of
