sumptio aut iniquitas judicet, altera quae desperat, altera
quae recusat veritatem. Deos vestros colere desinimus, ex
quo illos non esse cognoscimus. Hoc igitur exigere debetis,
uti probemus non esse illos deos, et idcirco non colendos,
quia tunc demum coli debuissent, si dii fuissent. Tunc et5
Christiani puniendi, si quos non colerent, quia putarent non

‘ prejudice' ; and so used ch. 49: here in a similar way of the philo-
sophic cynicism which asks ‘Quid est veritas'Z despairing of its ac—
cessibility. Comp. Min. Felix 1. Praesumptio became an ordinary
term of reproach against the Christians like dementia, obstinatio, etc. ;
comp. ad Nat. i. 19 ; de test. anim. 4.

2. Deos vestros colere desinimus. Their eonsciousness of the
falsity of the heathen gods impelled the Christians to go further and
directly assail the worship of them: J ustin Mart. Apol. i. 5. Hence
the popular outcry ‘ Tolle sacrilegos ' 1 ‘ Christiani non sint '3 Αἶρε τοὺς

Origen, Lactantius, and Arnobius: see Gibbon ii. 22 5 ; and Merivale
Hist. Rom. vii. 381, that it was ‘the last refuge of declining Paganism,

follow, of course, that the Christians too must be punished, if . . .’

8. Sed nobis, inquitis, dii sunt. Tertullian anticipates and
answers three pleas put forward by his opponents, of which this is
the first. ‘The gods are gods to us, though you may be indifferent to
their olaims.' It is taken up again ch. 13. Here Tertullian contents
himself with an appeal to the heathen conscience to deny, if it can,
that the pagan gods were originally mortal men. This leads up to the
consideration of the second heathen plea in the next chapter.

Appellamus et provocamus. These are technical juridical
terms for ‘carrying an appeal to a higher court.' ‘ We protest and
appeal from yourselves to your consciences.’

11. inficias si ierit : inficias ire in legal terminology= ‘to contest
a point at law,' ‘ to deny.’
