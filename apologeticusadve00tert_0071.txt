CAP. IX.] adversus Gentes pro Christianis. 33

Major aetas apud Gallos Mercurio prosecabatur. Remitto
Tauricas fabulas theatris suis. Ecce in illa religiosissima
urbe Aeneadarum piorum est Jupiter quidam, quem ludis
suis humano proluunt sanguine. Sed bestiarii, inquitis. Hoc,
opinor, minus quam hominis, An hoc turpius, quod mali 5
hominis‘.l Certe tamen de homicidio funditur. O J ovem
Christianum et solum patris filium de crudelitate! Sed
quoniam de infanticidio nihil interest, sacro an arbitrio per-

1. prosecabatur: a sacrificial term used especially of the exta vic-
timarum3 but here in a general sense, and so ch. 23, 46.

2. Tauricas fabulas. The Taurians were a Thracian tribe, living
in Tauric Chersonese (Crimea), who sacrificed strangers to Artemis, or
according to Herod. iv. 103, to Iphigenia. Gomp. Min. Fel. ch. 30,
‘ Tauris etiam Ponticis . . . fuit hospites immolare.'

3. Jupiter quidam: Jupiter Latiaris3 comp. Seorp. 7; Min. Fel.
21, ‘ et cum Latiaris [dicitur] cruore perfunditur ’ ; ib. 30 ; Lact. i. 21 ;
Macrob. i. 103 Plin. xxxiv. 7.

4. Sed bestiarii. ‘But only the blood of a criminal already con-

demned to the beasts, you say.’ A bestiarius (θηριομάχης) was a cri-
minal condemned to fight in the arena with wild beasts: he was un-
armed and sometimes bound (Vopisc. Aurez. 373 comp. de pudic. 22 ;
and below, ch. 12, 40), and his death was therefore certain. Some-
times unconvicted gladiators were hired to engage with the beasts for
the diversion of the spectators (de spect. 19); these were armed and,
if victorious, rewarded. Such an one is mentioned, ch. 16, as a mer-
cenarius noxias (see note): prisoners and slaves occasionally thus
fought for their liberty. Comp. Cicero in Vatia. 17. 40 ; pro Sest. 64.
135, ‘ praeclara aedilitas! unus leo, ducenti bestiarii.’

Hoc, opinor. This ironical opinor is frequently employed by
Tertullian. ‘ And therefore, Ι suppose, of less account than the blood

of m ’l
ἓ. daen homicidio funditur: contrasted with the more heinous

'c'd‘ .
PW'W‘Oz Jcbvem Christianum. This may be regarded as a bitterly
sarcastic adoption of the heathen charge against the Christians re-

torted upon Jupiter himself.
7. et solum patris filium: inasmuch as he alone escaped the fate

which befel Saturn’s other children of being devoured by their own
father. There is a parallel sarcastically hinted at between Jupiter as
fllia-3 unicus of Saturn, and Christ as Uniyenitus Patris Filias,

carrying on the irony of ‘ O J ovem Christianum ' !
8. sacro an arbitrio: ‘whether committed under religious sanc-

tions or out of mere caprice.’
