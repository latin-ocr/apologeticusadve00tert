SYNOPSIS.

Ι. Introduction.

CHAPTER Ι. The injustice which condemns the Christians unheard
arises from ignorance, but is nevertheless culpable.

, II. The ordinary procedure observed in all criminal cases
before condemnation,—namely, charge, defence‚ and
proof of guilt,—-is disregarded in our case alone.
If we are guilty, at least give us the same ad—
vantages as other criminals.

,‚ III. The mere name of ‘Christian' is made a term of
reproach and the ground of a criminal charge.

‚ IV. Even were we to establish our innocence there are laws
in existence antagonistic to us, laws both unjust and
inconsistent, and for the amendment of which there
is ample precedent.

V. Direct legislation against us has only procecded from
the worst emperors.

,, VI. You who avow the greatest reverence for the in-
stitutione and enactments of your ancestors are the
very people who most shamelessly disregard them.

11. Refutation of Accusations.

i. Sem-et Atrocities.

OHAPTER VII. We are charged with the most infamous secret enor-
mities on no evidence but that of mere rumour,—
and rumour is proverbially mendacious.

, VIII. The crimes you impute to us are absolutely impossible
to Christians.
IX. As a matter of fact it is you yourselves, and not we,
who commit such atrocities.

ii. Open Grimes.

1. Sacrilege.
CHAPTER X. You accuse us of sacrilege and disloyalty. We do not
reverence your gods, because they were once nothing

more than mortal men.
XI. They do not deserve the name of gods, for they created

nothing, and were moreover guilty of hideous crimes.
, XII. You yourselves heap indignities and insults upon
them, similar to those which you inflict upon us.
